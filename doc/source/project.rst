Clexa Rikleimt
==============
The first few months of 2016 were brutal for many female LGBT characters in the media. The 100 was one of the most high
profile examples, in part because the fandom had been so horribly queer-baited. The show runners promised that
Lexa and Clexa would be groundbreaking representation. With the consummation of Clarke and Lexa’s relationship,
LGBT fans were given hope for their own happy ending, only to have it tragically ripped away a mere minute later. This
had a profound impact on the fans that were desperate to finally see themselves positively represented in mainstream
media. Rikleimt has decided that enough is enough. We are not going to accept that our only choices in representation
end in death or loss. We deserve better.

Our goal is to rewrite season 3 of The 100. We feel that the storyline and general direction was incredibly harmful
and traumatizing. In addition, we also believe that the storyline was poorly written and was, in many ways, downright
nonsensical. Therefore, we are going to be rewriting the story into one of hope, and do justice to the characters that
we fell in love with. We want to provide positive representation to minority groups, not just LGBT+, something that we
believe the show failed to do and are taking upon ourselves now.

For this project, success means many things. The core of the project is obviously rewriting season 3, but that’s just
the beginning. We aim to accomplish something that goes beyond just a fix-it-fic, as there are already so many
great ones already available online. Our goal is to engage all the creativity and passion of the Clexa fandom to expand
the universe itself. Rikleimt will include illustrations, animations, original musical pieces, wiki articles and more.
We would really love to see as many different types of content and talent involved as possible to bring new life, not
only to the characters, but to the fandom.

Website
-------
The goal of the Clexa Rikleimt project is to make a multimedia experience. This will be presented on a website
specifically designed for this goal. This is the task of Tekkru.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that this website will be build using a web framework called Flask, that runs on
Python. For this, we use Python 3.
