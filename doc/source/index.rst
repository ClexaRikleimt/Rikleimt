Documentation for the Clexa Rikleimt website (in development)
=============================================================
The following pages contain the documentation for the website of the Clexa Rikleimt project. This documentation is
meant for both new and existing developers of the website, as well as the project management, or rather the council,
to get an idea of how things work and what should be done in the future. It will function as an introduction to new
developers to get a view of how the codebase is set up and for existing developers as a reference.
